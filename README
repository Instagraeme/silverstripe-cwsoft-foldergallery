========================================
PURPOSE:
========================================
Simple foldergallery module for Silverstripe to display images on a screen. 
Images can be uploaded via Silverstripe media manager or via FTP. The will create thumbnails for the uploaded images.
When clicking on the thumbnail, a Javascript colorbox opens a bigger view of the image. The image description is extracted
from the image filename (XX-your-image-description.ext --> Your image description). XX is a number to display images in
the order you like (e.g. 01, 02, .. 99).

========================================
INSTALLATION:
========================================
This module requires CMS Silverstripe in version v2.4.5 (not tested for upcoming v3).
Ftp the module to the root folder of your Silverstripe installation and rename the folder to what ever fits your needs.
Install the module and create the required database settings via visiting: "yourdomain.com/dev/build?flush=all".

========================================
USAGE OF THE GALLERY MODULE:
========================================
a) log into the Silverstripe backend and create a new page of type "cwsFolderGalleryPage" (e.g. named My Gallery)
b) switch to Silverstripes "media & image" section. Here you should see a new folder called "cws-foldergallery"
c) create a new subfolder inside "cws-foldergallery" which will hold all images of one specific album (e.g. cws-foldergallery/2012/)
d) upload some images to the new created folder (either via Silverstripe media manager, or via FTP)
e) use reload function of Silverstripe media section to update the database content (if uploaded via FTP)
f) go to page "My Gallery" in page section and select a subfolder from the dropdown list (e.g. 2012)
g) press save and you are done

========================================
Tip:
========================================
To organize your images in different albums, just add another page of type cwsFolderGalleryPage below the parent page.
Silverstripe page tree:
 - My Gallery (type: cwsFolderGalleryPage)
   - Album 2011 (type: cwsFolderGalleryPage)
   - Album 2012 (type: cwsFolderGalleryPage)
   
 --> this set-up will provide a list with available albums when visiting "My Gallery" page.
